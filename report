1. Introduction

The recent years has witnessed a boom in the development of artificial intelligence 
and its applications.  Especially the method of neutral network is getting increasing 
attention these days. though first proposed in 1940s, it was not until the advancement of 
parallel computing and GPU that it became so important. GAN, short for Generative Adversarial
network, is perhaps the most renowned and powerful tool in this realm. It has been proved
effective in generating photos of people, cats...even dialogs... In this paper we try 
to use GAN to generate animation character designs.
